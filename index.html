                            Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye or his origins.
                            An accomplished combatant and weapons master, he was present for Thor’s arrival on
                            Earth, and was impressed with the God of Thunder.
                            He was also instrumental in bringing over Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, to the side
                            of S.H.I.E.L.D, sparing her life and offering her a path to redemption.
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            For his extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of the
                            Avengers Initiative.
                            Unfortunately, in his first mission with the Avengers, he initially worked against them,
                            thanks his mind being controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief.
                            After being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did work alongside his fellow
                            Super Heroes to bring down the trickster god.
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against the Chitauri, Ultron,
                            HYDRA, and even his fellow Avengers when it seemed necessary.

                        <p> A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and
                            instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them. An orphan
                            living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as
                            not to burden her with his actions.

                            Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he’d constructed,
                            Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark.
                            The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at
                            his and May’s home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming
                            confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates.
                            Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill
                            of adventure and Stark’s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation,
                            as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.

                            <p> Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew
                                into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people.
                                Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to
                                the day of his ascension to the throne.
                                But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He
                                manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the
                                Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of
                                his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in
                                the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town.
                                While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to
                                ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant
                                king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep.
                                Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing
                                so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to full Asgardian power.

                                Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after
                                his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation.
                                While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy
                                came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded.
                                Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel
                                near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow
                                prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would
                                prolong it temporarily.
                            </p>

                                Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the
                                magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father,
                                the Arc Reactor.
                                Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the
                                means with which to escape.
                                The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony
                                enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.

                                Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma
                                radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab.
                                Dr. Ross’ father, General “Thunderbolt” Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work
                                into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both doctors.
                                When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic
                                transformation in himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own

                            cure to his bizarre affliction.

                                Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in
                                a Russian facility called the Red Room.
                                There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand
                                shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits.
                                However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for
                                the good guys.

                                Exhibiting no super human abilities, the Black Widow boasts ultimate human levels of
                                strength, agility, and stamina.
                                She is extensively trained to near perfection in a variety of fighting styles, such as
                                karate, judo, kung fu, and wrestling, and with all manner of weapons—both traditional and
                                high-tech—combined with her background in gymnastics, acrobatics, and ballet to always
                                accomplish her mission.
                                
                                
                                <p>
                                    She can use a simple handgun just as well as a Chitauri battle staff or even Captain
                                    America's shield.
                                    Her signature weapons include dual batons, a pair of Glock 26s and the Black Widow’s
                                    Bite—bracelets that discharge electricity.
                                    Romanoff also displays great skill when it comes to hacking in computers and technological
                                    systems to dig for information or regaining control.

                                Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own
                                multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more
                                attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World
                                War II. Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention
                                of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the
                                Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.

                                Though Rogers learned of Erskine’s disastrous previous attempts to realize a
                                super-soldier, Germany’s so-called “Red Skull,” he braved the process and emerged from
                                it a new man.
                                With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge
